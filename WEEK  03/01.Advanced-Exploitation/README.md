# Chained Exploit Demonstration: Stored XSS to Remote Code Execution (RCE)

## Overview
This project documents a successful chained exploitation scenario performed in an authorized lab environment using **Damn Vulnerable Web Application (DVWA)**. The attack demonstrates how a **Stored Cross-Site Scripting (XSS)** vulnerability can be leveraged to hijack an authenticated user session and escalated into **Remote Code Execution (RCE)** via command injection.

The objective of this exercise is to illustrate real-world exploit chaining, evidence collection, and professional reporting aligned with VAPT and PTES standards.

## Environment Details
- **Target Application:** DVWA (TryHackMe Lab)
- **Target IP:** `10.49.161.227`
- **Attacker Machine:** Kali Linux
- **Security Level:** Low
- **Scope:** Authorized lab environment only

## Attack Chain Summary

## Evidence and Screenshots

### 1. Session Hijacking via Stored XSS
**File:** `cookie hyjack.png`

- A Stored XSS payload was used to exfiltrate the victim’s session cookie.
- The stolen `PHPSESSID` was captured using a Netcat listener on port 80.
- The cookie was later reused to impersonate an authenticated user.

**Impact:**
- Authentication bypass
- Unauthorized access to restricted application functionality

---

### 2. Command Injection Execution
**File:** `payload execution.png`

- Using the hijacked session, the attacker accessed the DVWA Command Injection module.
- Arbitrary command execution was confirmed using the `id` command.
- Output verified execution under the `www-data` user context.

**Evidence:**


**Impact:**
- Server-side command execution
- Confirmation of Remote Code Execution capability

---

### 3. Reverse Shell Establishment
**File:** `shell.png`

- A Bash reverse shell payload was injected through the vulnerable parameter.
- The target successfully initiated an outbound connection to the attacker.
- An interactive shell was obtained on the target system.

**Evidence:**

**Impact:**
- Full control of the web server under web service privileges
- Potential for privilege escalation and lateral movement
