# Post-Exploitation and Evidence Collection

## Overview
This document covers the post-exploitation and evidence collection phase of a web application penetration test conducted in an authorized lab environment. The objective of Task 4 was to verify system access obtained during exploitation, perform controlled enumeration, and collect forensic-safe evidence while respecting privilege boundaries and chain-of-custody principles.

## Environment Details
- **Target Application:** Damn Vulnerable Web Application (DVWA)
- **Target IP:** 10.49.161.227
- **Attacker System:** Kali Linux
- **Access Level:** Web service account (`www-data`)
- **Environment Type:** Authorized lab

## Post-Exploitation Activities

### 1. Reverse Shell Establishment
A reverse shell was successfully established from the target system to the attacker machine. The shell was stabilized to allow reliable command execution.

**Actions Performed:**
- Reverse shell connection received
- Pseudo-terminal spawned using Python
- Terminal environment configured

**Result:**
- Interactive shell access obtained under the `www-data` context

### 2. Identity and Context Verification
The identity and privilege level of the compromised account were verified to confirm access scope.
