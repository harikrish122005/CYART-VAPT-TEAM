# Exploitation – Windows SMB (MS17-010 EternalBlue)

## Objective

To validate identified vulnerabilities by performing controlled exploitation of a vulnerable Windows system and demonstrate the real-world impact of insecure and unpatched SMB services.

```Target Information
Item	Details
Target Machine	Windows 7
Target Service	SMB (Port 445)
Vulnerability	MS17-010 (EternalBlue)
Target IP	10.49.165.28
Attacker Machine	Kali Linux
Exploitation Framework	Metasploit
Exploitation Method
```

Based on the results of SMB vulnerability scanning, the target system was identified as vulnerable to MS17-010, a critical remote code execution vulnerability affecting Microsoft SMBv1.

The vulnerability was confirmed using Nmap’s SMB vulnerability detection script, which indicated that the target was susceptible to EternalBlue exploitation.

The Metasploit exploit module
exploit/windows/smb/ms17_010_eternalblue
was selected to perform the exploitation.

The exploit was configured with the target IP address and the attacker’s local IP address for reverse shell communication. Upon execution, the exploit successfully triggered a memory corruption vulnerability in the SMB service, allowing arbitrary code execution.

A Meterpreter reverse TCP payload was delivered to the target system as part of the exploitation process.

### Result

The exploitation was successful and resulted in remote code execution on the target system.
A Meterpreter session was established, providing interactive shell access.

Post-exploitation validation confirmed that the session was running with NT AUTHORITY\SYSTEM privileges, indicating full administrative control over the target machine.

This confirms a critical severity vulnerability, as an unauthenticated remote attacker was able to fully compromise the system.

Privilege escalation was not required, as SYSTEM-level access was obtained directly during exploitation.

### Evidence

The following evidence was collected during exploitation:

Successful EternalBlue exploit execution via Metasploit

Meterpreter session establishment

Confirmation of SYSTEM-level privileges using getuid

Exploit configuration and execution logs

(All screenshots and terminal outputs are included in this repository as proof.)

### Conclusion

This exploitation demonstrates the severe impact of running outdated and unpatched SMB services. The MS17-010 vulnerability allows complete system compromise without authentication, highlighting the importance of timely security updates, SMB hardening, and network segmentation to prevent such attacks.
